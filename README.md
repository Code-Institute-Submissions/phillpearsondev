<h2>"Modus Operandi" (Band Website)</h2></br>
<hr>
<h3>Introduction</h3></br>
<p>For my User Centric Milestone Project with 'Code Institute', I have landed on the idea; to produce a band website based off of my own band called 'Modus Operandi', of which allows me to draw a heavy amount of inspiration as it is already a major part of my hobbies. Plus I can use this project to prototype ideas both for the bands aesthetic aswell as for future Code Institute course projects. Such an eccentricity driving myself forward, will allow me to put greater brainpower and energy into testing my abillity both in design and with how much I have managed to integrate of what I have learned so far.</br> In this documentation, you should find, a list files contained within the project. Instrutions for using Git, with Microsoft Visual Studio Code (as that is my preffered program currently), a 'to-do-list' (largely for my own record) detailing each stage of development I intend to go through. Following that would be an 'Updates' section, detailing the changes and progression of the project that actually occured. and lastly, would be a Citations section, for any inspiration/libraries or other asset source used in my project.</br></br>
Kind regards,</br>Phillip Allen Pearson</p>

<h3>Git Commands Reference</h3></br>
<p>
For use via <b>'Microsot Visual Studio Code'</b></br>
<b>Note:</b> You must have the GitHub extensions installed aswell as Git and GitLens in order for the following process to work as written.</br>
<ol>
<li>In the Visual Studio Terminal, type <b>"cd"</b> and the name of the folder that you are storing your project files and structure. (you may need to "cd" into any subcategories) The terminal should update the current "dir" directory if successful and display it within the Terminal screen.</li></br></br>
  
<li>In the Terminal, type <b>"git remote add 'nickname your project' 'the full repositories URL' master"</b>. This will add a link between VS and your repository, and you can issue commands using the nickname you chose instead of having to type out the full URL every time.</li></br></br>
  
<li>Synch your Repository if you created it from a Template. by typing <b>"git pull 'project nickname' master"</b>. this will then create a synchronized git repository in your directory as stated above, that contains all present files from your orignal github repository.</li></br></br>
  
<li>Add files to staging area. In the Terminal window, type: <b>"git add 'filename'"</b> and press enter. (must include files entensions if you are adding a specific file).</li></br></br>

<li>add a whole folder. In the Terminal window, type: <b>"git add 'assets/css/'"</b> for example, to add an entire directory into the git staging area. Then press enter.</li></br></br>

<li>Check the staging area any time my typing <b>"git status"</b> into the Terminal window and pressing enter.</li></br></br>

<li><b>Commit your changes</b>. click <b>"Source Control"</b> which is the third icon down on the left hand side of the Visual Studio code window. providing you have GitLens installed, you should which files have been staged with Git. it's good practice to click the <b>refresh</b> icon before committing so you can see the most up-to-date changes. In the textbox within this panel, <b>type your commit message</b>, this can be anything. Then <b>hold ctrl+enter</b> on your keyboard to commit those changes</li></br></br>

<li><b>Push your changes</b>. In the Terminal window, type: <b>"git push -u 'project nickname' master"</b>. Then hit enter/return. you should then see the terminal giving you updates on its progress in pushing your committed files to your github repository</li></br></br>
</ol>
