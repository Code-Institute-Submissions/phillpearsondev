                     <b>Born:</b> 20.12.1987</br></br>
                     <b>Why he was notorious:</b> Multi-Instrumentalist. Specialising in Vocals. Never stops "spittin' Lyrics".</br></br>
                     <b>How we caught him:</b> He first met Phill, when he turned up to audition as Vocalist for Phill's older band
                     by name of "Skurge Ov Man", of which at the time he was unsuccesful. They finally got into the habit of
                     producing music when Paul became the Bass player for the second Project Phill was also in called 
                     "Symphonies of a Sociopath". After that mess of a project failed (inevitably), he has been Vocalist of "Modus Operandi"
                     and joint band-leader with Phill, ever since.</br>

                     <b>Why he was notorious:</b> Multi-Instrumentalist. Specialising in Lead Guitar Techniques. Will not "shut the hell up"
                     when holding his instrument of choice.</br></br>
                     <b>How we caught him:</b> After the inevitable failure of the second Metal project "Symphonies of a Sociopath"
                     of which Phill was Lead Guitarist for, Paul kept in contact and persuaded Phill that they should not quit
                     "the band" and instead should form their own project, under which they would make up the Joint Leadership.
                     With Phill once again as Lead Guitarist.</br>

                     <b>How we caught her:</b> The younger of the tow Pearson siblings, who initially was
                     experimenting with synth-keyboards in various parts of the bands already written material.
                     After a while however she developed a love for Bass, bought a rare six string Bass Guitar
                     variant and demonstrated a very quick will to learn, improve and write for the bass both 
                     as a lead and rythm instrument, with particular focus of funk styling, which the band
                     desired as a dynamic in their growing soundscape.

                     <b>How we caught him:</b> As the band continued to grow in size, and other friends were allowed
                     in the band practice writing and practice session, Danjo demonstrated his abillity with his
                     instrument of choice by generally jamming along with the other members, and produced intresting
                     interpretations (as a band test) of several pop-artists songs. And quickly fell into the role
                     of the other Guitarist of the Band, with largely rythm and embellishment focussed dynamics.
